Analysis ready data for gravity observationsis a set of Matlab files to calculate gravimetric quasigeoid.

This repository introduces an open-source tool for computing gravimetric geoids using gravity observations. Our primary goal is to create a platform for analysis-ready gravity data, where algorithms and code for working with gravity data are openly shared and improved. The initial release features a tilewise least-squares collocation method based on gravity anomaly observations. Additionally, we provide analytical forms for spherical covariance function models related to gravity anomaly and gravity gradient. The document includes detailed information about the tilewise least squares collocation algorithm. You can find all the MATLAB M-files in the public repository here.
