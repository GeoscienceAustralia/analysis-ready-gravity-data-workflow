SUBROUTINE COVA(EPSrN1)

C (JES OF TABLE SEVEN AND EQUATION (68)e(THE QUANTITY S IN THE TABLE IS 
C HERE CALLED SE). 
C THERE ARE THREE ENTRIES TO THE SUBROUTINE, WHICH HAVE TO BE CALLED IN 
C THE SEQUENCE COVA?COVB AND COVC. 
C BY THE CALL OF COVA, THE KIND OF COVARIANCE FUNCTION TO BE USED IS 
C DETERMINED. THERE ARE THREE POSSIBILITIES: 
C (1) THE COVARIANCE MODEL FOUR (EQUATIONS (130)-(132) AND (136)-(139)) 
C IS USED WITHOUT MODIFICATIONS. IN THIS CASE EPS WILL BE A DUMMY 
C ARRAY AND N1 MUST BE EQUAL TO ONE. 
C THE LOGICAL VARIABLE MODEL WILL GET THE VALUE TRUE IN THIS CASE, 
C (2) A NUMBER (NI) OF THE ANOMALY DEGREE-VARIANCES (DEGREE ZERO TO 
C NI-l) ARE PUT EQUAL TO EMPIRICAL DETERMINED DEGREE-VAKIANCES. 
C THE DEGREE-VARIANCE OF DEGRFE K WILL HAVE TO BE STOHFD IN 
C EPS(K+l) (IN UNITS OF MGAL**2). 
C 13) THE DEGREE-VARIANCES CIF DEGREE zEun TU N = NI-i ARE PUT EQUAL TO 
C ZEKOe(AND THE OTHERS ARE THE SAME AS ABOVE DESCK1HED)e THIS MEANS 
C THAT AN N'TH ORDER LOCAL COVARIANCE FUNCTION WILL BE COMPUTED. IN 
C THIS CASE EPS MUST HAVE NZ ZERO VALUES STORED, 
C IN ALL CASES N1 MUST BE LESS THAN 300 AND EPS MUST HAVE DIMENSION 
C N1.
